### Objective
#### What were yoy supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this lab, we were told to calculate the total amount of money owed
in a month based on what data package the user picked, how much GB they used,
and if they had a coupon for the green package.

### Procedure
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. First we created an algorith so we could visualize how the program would behave.
2. Then we created test cases so we could see the expected results of the program.
3. Lastly we wrote the code for the program, and debugged it until it functioned how it was intended.

#### What were the key concepts explored?
In this lab we used "While" statements in a program, and learned how to create a functioning while loop. 

#### Did your results match what you expected to get?
The results of the program lined up with the test cases, so yes.

#### Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
We just used various regular test cases. Due to the nature of some of the variables, there was little room 
to create "extreme" test cases.

### Reflection
#### What challenge did you encounter?
Creating and debugging the while loop was really tricky, but we eventually were able to figure it out.

#### How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
We created the algorithm before coding, we made sure the program was readable by making the variable names clear 
and including comments, and we practiced with the test cases beforehand so we were prepared to write the code for the program.

#### Did you overcome them and how?
We overcame the issues mostly by trial and error, but also through doing extra research on how while loops function.

#### Any Key takeaways?
Understanding how to use while loops makes writing code so much easier.

#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
I have a pretty clear understanding of how to use while loops after completing this lab.

#### What was it like working with your partner?
Working with Teresa was great, she took initiative, and created the basis of the code for this program. 
She was also really helpful while we created the algorithm.
