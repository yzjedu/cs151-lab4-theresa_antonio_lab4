Reflection: 

One of the challenges I encountered was being able to write the while loop and not get stuck in the loop. However, after
learning to use the "and" statements with the "not equal" statements I figured out the while loop and the program ran
correctly. I followed the three rules of programming by preparing to write the code with an algorithm and test cases. 
I followed the third rule of programming by practicing the code several times and testing the code to make sure it matches 
our test cases. I followed the second rule of programming by creating a human-readable essay with our algorithm that can
be followed by a code. With the help of tutoring I was able to fix the problem and have the program to run successfully.
Some key takeaways I have from this lab are how to write a while loop and print with two decimal places. I do think I 
learned what I was supposed to because I learned string input, decision making, and input validation with loops. 
Working with Antonio was great! We communicated out of class to get the work done since we didn't finish it in lab and we
contributed to the project equally. Lab 4 was very successful.
